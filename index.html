                    and I will be joining the workforce soon as a Software Engineer for Northrop Grumman. I
                    hope that I will be able to meet as many fellow CS students as possible before I leave

                    Computer Science major here at Cal Poly Pomona. As the treasurer of CSS, I am
                    excited to be able to provide opportunities for members to network with important
                    in-field mentors and have access to resources and workshops that will help them
                    grow and satisfy their academic curiosity. I was first exposed to CS and coding at
                    a young age and soon fell in love with technology. One of the main reasons I decided to
                    pursue a CS degree was because of the endless possibilities CS provides
                    to anyone and everyone with access to the knowledge and technology. I have a love
                    for learning new languages that has allowed me to learn how to understand and speak
                    over 5 languages and driven me to learn how to code in Python, Java, C++, etc. I hope
                    to work in the field of Cybersecurity in the future. I am looking forward to helping
                    our club members through their journey as a CS major here at CPP. I believe a priority
                    is to strive to create a warm and connected environment where members can learn from
                    one another and foster communication and growth, both academically and socially.</p>
