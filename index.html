                    Pomona and I am going to be graduating this year. I am currently the secretary of CSS
                    and I will be joining the workforce soon as a Software Engineer for Northrop Grumman. I
                    hope that I will be able to meet as many fellow CS students as possible before I leave
                    CPP to further expand our knowledge in the field in innovative ways.</p>

                    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Prathista Annapareddi, and I am currently a third-year
                    Computer Science major here at Cal Poly Pomona. As the treasurer of CSS, I am
                    excited to be able to provide opportunities for members to network with important
                    in-field mentors and have access to resources and workshops that will help them
                    grow and satisfy their academic curiosity. I was first exposed to CS and coding at
                    a young age and soon fell in love with technology. One of the main reasons I decided to
                    pursue a CS degree was because of the endless possibilities CS provides
                    to anyone and everyone with access to the knowledge and technology. I have a love
                    for learning new languages that has allowed me to learn how to understand and speak
                    over 5 languages and driven me to learn how to code in Python, Java, C++, etc. I hope
                    to work in the field of Cybersecurity in the future. I am looking forward to helping
                    our club members through their journey as a CS major here at CPP. I believe a priority
                    is to strive to create a warm and connected environment where members can learn from
                    one another and foster communication and growth, both academically and socially.</p>

                    Poly Pomona majoring in Computer Science. I have been fascinated by the world of
                    technology ever since I was kid, starting with my interest in video games and how much
                    I would play on the computer. In my free time, I like to play video games, hang out
                    with friends, work out, play basketball, and go on long drives while blasting my music.
                    In the future, I hope to do work and research in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
                    As someone who loves to interact and connect with various people, I want to bring and 
                    emphasize this important concept as a core club value.</p>

                In this project, we redesigned the whole club website, handled by two talented persons, one UI/UX designer and the other web developer. This was an ongoing semester project which taught them the basic concepts of web design, version control with GitHub, and important aspects of website maintenance.
